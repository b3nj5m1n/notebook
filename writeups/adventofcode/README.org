* Footnote
I used this command to download all the html files:
#+begin_src shell :exports code :eval never
for year in $(seq 2015 2020); do for day in $(seq 1 25); do mkdir -p "./$year/"; curl "$base_url$year/day/$day" > "./$year/$day.html"; done; done
#+end_src
And this one to extract the titles for all the days:
#+begin_src shell :exports code :eval never
for year in $(seq 2015 2020); do for day in $(seq 1 25); do rg "day-desc" "./$year/$day.html" | sd '.*<h2>(.+?)</h2>.*' '$1' | sd -- '--- (.+?) ---' '--- Year '$year', $1 ---'; done; done
#+end_src
To also do the scores, first manually copy the [[https://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard/self][personal leaderboard]] (Select everything and control c), paste all of that into a file called =scores.csv= in the directory of that year.

Write to a file:
#+begin_src shell
file="./index.org"; echo "" > "$file"; for year in $(seq 2015 2020); do echo "* $year" >> "$file"; for day in $(seq 1 25); do echo "$year - $day"; title=$(rg "day-desc" "./$year/$day.html" | sd '.*<h2>(.+?)</h2>.*' '$1' | sd -- '--- (.+?) ---' '--- Year $1 ---'); echo "** $title" >> "$file"; sed "$(((25-day)+3))q;d" "./$year/scores.csv" | sd ' +' ',' | awk -F ',' '{printf "| | Time | Rank | Score |\n|--+--|--+--|--+--|\n| Part 1 | %s | %s | %s |\n| Part 2 | %s | %s | %s |\n",$3,$4,$5,$6,$7,$8}' >> "$file"; done; done;
#+end_src
Echo to stout:
#+begin_src shell
for year in $(seq 2015 2020); do echo "* $year"; for day in $(seq 1 25); do title=$(rg "day-desc" "./$year/$day.html" | sd '.*<h2>(.+?)</h2>.*' '$1' | sd -- '--- (.+?) ---' '--- Year $1 ---'); stats=$(sed "$(((25-day)+3))q;d" "./$year/scores.csv" | sd ' +' ',' | awk -F ',' '{printf "| | Time | Rank | Score |\n|--+--|--+--|--+--|\n| Part 1 | %s | %s | %s |\n| Part 2 | %s | %s | %s |\n",$3,$4,$5,$6,$7,$8}'); echo "** $title\n$stats"; done; done;
#+end_src
